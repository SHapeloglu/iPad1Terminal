# AGENTS

## Mandatory first read

Before changing code, read in this order:

1. `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
2. `SESSION.md`
3. `ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. `TASKS.md`
5. `TESTING.md`
6. `INTEGRATION.md`
7. `README.md`

`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` contains the permanent project constraints.

`SESSION.md` contains the latest actual state and the immediate next action.

---

## Non-negotiable constraints

Never silently change:

```text
iPad 1
iOS 5.1.1
armv7
256 MB RAM
jailbreak
Theos
Objective-C
MRC / non-ARC
UIKit / Foundation
```

No Swift.

No modern API migration.

No WebView terminal.

No heavy dependency added without explicit approval.

---

## Current SDK rule

Use:

```make
TARGET = iphone:clang:6.1:5.1
```

unless a later documented decision changes it.

Do not revert to the 9.3 SDK target that produced simulator `.tbd` / armv7 linker problems.

---

## Current phase rule

Do not start SSH until the current Local Terminal/input and ANSI screen-buffer milestones are completed as described in `SESSION.md` and `TASKS.md`.

The user explicitly wants a real terminal application, not merely a thin SSH launcher.

---

## Code organization

Keep responsibilities separate:

```text
TerminalViewController
TerminalInputView
TerminalANSIParser
LocalTerminalSession
future TerminalScreen
future SSHSession
```

Do not put all logic into one controller.

---

## MRC rules

- every `alloc/init`, `copy`, `retain` must have clear ownership
- release owned ivars in `dealloc`
- delegates should generally be `assign` in this legacy architecture
- avoid retain cycles
- use autorelease pools in long-running background loops

---

## Memory rules

iPad 1 has 256 MB RAM.

Required:

- bounded scrollback
- bounded parser state
- bounded screen buffer
- small read buffers
- avoid unlimited arrays/strings
- avoid multiple terminal sessions by default
- no expensive animated UI

---

## Compatibility rules

Never assume an API exists on iOS 5.1.1.

Examples already discovered:

- `UITextView.selectable` is not available
- newer SDK enum typing may create warnings treated as errors

If a modern SDK header compiles but runtime support is uncertain, verify iOS 5 availability before using it.

---

## Terminal correctness

Do not “fix” ANSI behavior merely by stripping all escape codes permanently.

The current lightweight parser is transitional.

The target is a real bounded terminal screen model.

---

## Security

Never:

- log passwords
- log private keys
- store plaintext SSH passwords in plist
- allow arbitrary external command execution through URL schemes

---

## Documentation update rule

After a meaningful coding/testing session update:

- `SESSION.md`
- `TASKS.md`
- `TESTING.md` when tests change
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` when design changes
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` only for durable project-level decisions

`SESSION.md` must always end with a clear:

```text
Immediate next action
```

so a new chat can continue without guessing.

---

## Git rule

Before pushing:

```bash
git status -sb
git diff --check
```

Do not commit:

- `.theos/`
- generated package build directories
- temporary files
- passwords
- private keys

Commit source and project documentation.

Generated `.deb` packages should only be committed if explicitly desired.

---

## Development priority

```text
stability
compatibility
terminal correctness
low RAM
usability
SSH
advanced features
```
